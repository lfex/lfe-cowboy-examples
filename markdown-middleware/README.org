* Markdown middleware example
To try this example, you need GNU ~make~ and ~git~ in your =PATH=.

** Building
To build the example, run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
make
#+END_SRC

** Starting
*** Release
To start the release in the foreground:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
./_rel/markdown-middleware-example/bin/markdown-middleware-example console
#+END_SRC
*Note*: The previous command also starts an Erlang console.

*** LFE
To start the app and an LFE shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
lfe -pa ebin -pa deps/*/ebin -s markdown-middleware # make dev
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Point your browser at [[http://localhost:8080/video.html]].

Cowboy will serve all the files you put in the =priv= directory.
If you request a =.html= file that has a corresponding =.md= file
that has been modified more recently than the =.html= file, the
Markdown file will be converted to HTML and served by Cowboy.
