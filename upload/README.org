* Multipart upload example
To try this example, you need GNU ~make~ and ~git~ in your =PATH=.

If you don't have [[https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie][HTTPie]] installed, use the appropriate [[http://curl.haxx.se/docs/manual.html][cURL]] commands instead.

** Building
To build the example, run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
make
#+END_SRC

** Starting
*** Release
To start the release in the foreground:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
./_rel/upload-example/bin/upload-example console
#+END_SRC
*Note*: The previous command also starts an Erlang console.

*** LFE
To start the app and an LFE shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
lfe -pa ebin -pa deps/*/ebin -s upload # make dev
#+END_SRC

** Usage
Point your browser at [[http://localhost:8080]].

The uploaded file will be displayed in the shell directly.

** Example output
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
Received file <<"mccarthy_desktop.png">> of content-type <<"image/png">> as follows:
%% giant binary representing the image
#+END_SRC
